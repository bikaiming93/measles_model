## üìÑ Summary

This study evaluates the impact of the MMR vaccination strategies on measles transmission in Texas during the 2025 outbreak. Using a stochastic age-structured SEIR-HD model, we compare outbreak outcomes under different vaccine uptakes scenarios (baseline, 5% decrease, 5% increase).
