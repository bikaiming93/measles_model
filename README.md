## 📄 Summary

This study evaluates the impact of varying MMR vaccination strategies on measles transmission in Texas during the 2025 outbreak. Using a stochastic age-structured SEIR-HD model, we compare outbreak outcomes under different vaccine action mechanisms (all-or-nothing vs. leaky) and vaccination coverage scenarios.

**Key components of the study:**
- Empirical estimation of the effective reproduction number (Rₜ)
- Gamma-distributed serial interval assumptions (mean = 11.5 days, SD = 2.5 days)
- Bayesian estimation of age-specific hospitalization rates using Stan
- Scenario-based simulations under baseline, increased, and decreased vaccination coverage
